# Zi8gzag Higher or Lower

A simple game where you have to guess if the next video has more or fewer views than the current one.

Built for the **@zi8gzag** community because why not.

## How to play
1. Look at the view count of the video on the left.
2. Guess if the video on the right has **HIGHER** or **LOWER** views.
3. Try to get the highest streak possible.
4. If you lose, you start over. Simple as that.

Have fun!
